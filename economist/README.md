# Economist Perspective â€” Problem Set 1

## Summary
This section provides the theoretical foundation of the one-round **Trust Game**, focusing on the **Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)**.

## Key Content
- Definition of SPNE (paraphrased with formal notation).
- Existence theorem: proof idea via **backward induction**.
- Analytical solution for the Trust Game:
  - Player B returns 0 in all subgames.
  - Anticipating this, Player A invests 0.
- Welfare analysis:
  - SPNE is individually rational but not Pareto optimal.
  - Cooperative outcomes could improve efficiency and fairness.

## Relation to Other Parts
- **Computational Scientist:** SPNE prediction matches Nash equilibria computed in normal and extensive form (NashPy & GTE).  
- **Behavioral Scientist:** Human and LLM experiments deviate from SPNE due to fairness, reciprocity, or framing.
