# Trust Game LLM Session Transcript

## Experiment Setup
- **Game:** *One-round Trust Game*  
- **Multiplier:** **3**  
- **Roles:** LLM plays as **Player A** or **Player B** depending on the round  
- **Player A Decision:** invest **0, 50, or 100**  
- **Player B Decision:** return **0, 50%, or 100%** of what they received  

**Instructions for LLM:**  
- Explain reasoning in 1–2 sentences.  
- Choose actions to maximize payoff and optionally consider fairness/reciprocity.  
- Respond according to assigned role.

## Session Rounds

| Round | Player A Investment | Player B Return | Player A Payoff | Player B Payoff | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| 1     | **50**            | **75**         | **125**        | **75**         | LLM as Player B returned 50% of received amount to encourage trust. |
| 2     | **0**             | **0**          | **100**        | **0**          | Matches SPNE prediction: no investment, no return. |
| 3     | **50 (LLM as A)** | **0**          | **50**         | **150**        | SPNE outcome; Player B returns 0. |
| 4     | **100 (LLM as A)**| **0**          | **0**          | **300**        | SPNE outcome; maximum payoff for Player B. |
| 5     | **0 (LLM as A)**  | **0**          | **100**        | **0**          | SPNE outcome repeated. |

## Observations
- In early rounds, the LLM sometimes returned a portion of the investment to encourage trust, reflecting **social reasoning**.  
- In later rounds, the LLM consistently chose to return **0**, which is **payoff-maximizing** and aligns with SPNE.  
- LLM behavior is more **stable** and **predictable** than humans, but still sensitive to **framing** and **role assignment**.  
- This session illustrates the difference between strict backward-induction **SPNE reasoning** and a combination of **rationality** with **fairness considerations**.

## Conclusion
- The LLM’s decisions provide a **clear, reproducible dataset** for Part 3b of the assignment.  
- Highlights potential refinements to SPNE to account for **social preferences**, which can be modeled in a **Behavioral SPNE** framework.
