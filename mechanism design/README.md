This folder contains all materials related to **Problem Set 2: Auction Mechanism Design and LLM Experiments** for COMPSCI-ECON206.

## Contents

- **Prompts and Experiment Setup**
  - `round1_prompt_GPT4.txt` – GPT-4 bidding prompts for Round 1
  - `round1_prompt_DeepSeek.txt` – DeepSeek bidding prompts for Round 1
  - `round2_prompt_*.txt` – Prompts for subsequent rounds

- **Transcripts & Logs**
  - `GPT4_transcripts/` – Contains recorded responses and bidding decisions from GPT-4
  - `DeepSeek_transcripts/` – Contains recorded responses and bidding decisions from DeepSeek

- **Results & Tables**
  - `bidding_results.xlsx` or `.csv` – Summary of bids, winners, payments, profits, and reasoning
  - `summary_table.tex` – LaTeX table for Overleaf integration

- **Analysis**
  - `experiment_analysis.md` – Short description of outcomes, comparison to theory, and observations
  - Optional: scripts for data visualization if used

## Usage

1. Reference the prompts to reproduce LLM bidding experiments.
2. Check transcripts to validate each round’s bids.
3. Use the results table for LaTeX integration in Overleaf.
4. Read `experiment_analysis.md` for interpretations and hypothesis evaluation.
